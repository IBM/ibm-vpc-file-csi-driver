ibm-vpc-file-csi-driver is a CSI plugin for creating and mounting VPC file storage on IBM VPC infrastructure based openshift or kubernetes cluster

# Supported orchestration platforms

The following table details orchestration platforms suitable for deployment of the IBM VPC file storage CSI driver.

|Orchestration platform|Version|Architecture|
|----------------------|-------|------------|
|Kubernetes|1.21|x86|
|Kubernetes|1.20|x86|
|Kubernetes|1.19|x86|
|Red Hat® OpenShift®|4.7|x86|
|Red Hat OpenShift|4.6|x86|

# Prerequisites

To use the file Storage for IBM VPC driver, complete the following tasks:

1. Create a cluster based on IBM VPC infrastructure

# Build the driver

For building the driver `docker` and `GO` should be installed

1. On your local machine, install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [`Go`](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. GO version should be >=1.16
3. Set the [`GOPATH` environment variable](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).
4. Build the driver image

   ## Clone the repo or your forked repo

   ```
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM/
   $ git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-vpc-file-csi-driver.git
   $ cd ibm-vpc-file-csi-driver
   ```
   ## Build project and runs testcases

   ```
   $ make
   ```
   ## Build container image for the driver

   ```
   $ make buildimage
   ```

   ## Push image to registry

   Image should be pushed to any registry from which the worker nodes have access to pull

   You can push the driver image to [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/)  registry or [IBM public registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview#registry_regions_local) under your namespace.

   For pushing to IBM registry:

   Create an image pull secret in your cluster

   1. Review and retrieve the following values for your image pull secret.

      `<docker-username>` - Enter the string: `iamapikey`.

      `<docker-password>` - Enter your IAM API key. For more information about IAM API keys, see [ Understanding API keys ](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey).

      `<docker-email>` - Enter the string: iamapikey.

   2. Run the following command to create the image pull secret in your cluster. Note that your secret must be named icr-io-secret


      ```

       kubectl create secret docker-registry icr-io-secret --docker-server=icr.io --docker-username=iamapikey --docker-password=-<iam-api-key> --docker-email=iamapikey -n kube-system

      ```


# Deploy CSI driver on your cluster

- Install `kustomize` tool. The instructions are available [here](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
- Export cluster config
- Deploy CSI plugin on your cluster
  - You can use any overlays available under `deploy/kubernetes/driver/kubernetes/overlays/` and edit the image tag
  - Example using `stage` overlay to update the image tag
     - Change `iks-vpc-file-driver` image name in `deploy/kubernetes/driver/kubernetes/overlays/stage/controller-server-images.yaml`
     - Change `iks-vpc-file-driver` image name in `deploy/kubernetes/driver/kubernetes/overlays/stage/node-server-images.yaml`
  - Deploy plugin
    - `sh deploy/kubernetes/driver/kubernetes/deploy-vpc-file-driver.sh stage`

## Testing

- Create storage classes
  - `ls deploy/kubernetes/storageclass/ | xargs -I classfile kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/storageclass/classfile`
- Create PVC
  - `kubectl create -f examples/kubernetes/validPVC.yaml`
- .Create POD with volume
  - `kubectl create -f examples/kubernetes/validPOD.yaml`
